## Overview

Lotus is a proof-of-concept full-stack home rentals application designed to connect Apple platforms with cloud and graph-based technologies seamlessly. The initial focus is to establish an end-to-end modern platform that serves as a reference for various domains.

Once the foundations are established, the project's ultimate goal will be centered around applying various aspects of data science and machine learning to the technology stack.

## Principles

- Each feature/subdomain resides in its own folder.
- This enables a focus on full-stack development within the domain.
- Each feature should be free to evolve independently with its own design choices. (Languages, dependencies, etc.)
- Features are then composed on the platform level as needed.

- Listings: Home listings management
- Bookings: Booking management
- Reviews: Guest and host reviews
